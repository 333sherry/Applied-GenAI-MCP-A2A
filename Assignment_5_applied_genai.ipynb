        "\n",
        "The MCP protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0 messages over HTTP with SSE. Key message types:\n",
        "- **initialize**: Handshake to establish connection and capabilities\n",
        "- **tools/list**: Request list of available tools\n",
        "- **tools/call**: Execute a specific tool\n",
        "\n",

        "Now that you've tested the server locally, let's try it with **MCP Inspector**!\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is MCP Inspector?\n",
        "\n",
        "MCP Inspector is a web-based tool from Anthropic that provides a visual interface for testing MCP servers. It's like Postman, but specifically designed for the MCP protocol.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How to Use MCP Inspector:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Get your public URL** from the server startup output above (it looks like `https://xxxx.ngrok.io`)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Open MCP Inspector**:\n",
        "   - Go to [https://inspector.anthropic.com](https://inspector.anthropic.com)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Connect to your server**:\n",
        "   - In the \"Server URL\" field, enter: `<your-ngrok-url>/mcp`\n",
        "   - Example: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/mcp`\n",
        "   - Click \"Connect\"\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Explore the tools**:\n",
        "   - You'll see all 6 customer management tools listed\n",
        "   - Click on any tool to see its description and parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Test a tool**:\n",
        "   - Click on \"list_customers\"\n",
        "   - Leave the parameters empty (or add `{\"status\": \"active\"}`)\n",
        "   - Click \"Call Tool\"\n",
        "   - See the results in real-time!\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Try other tools**:\n",
        "   - Get a specific customer: `{\"customer_id\": 1}`\n",
        "   - Add a customer: `{\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"email\": \"john@example.com\"}`\n",
        "   - Update, disable, or activate customers\n",
        "\n",
        "### Benefits of MCP Inspector:\n",
        "\n",
        "- ✅ Visual interface for testing\n",
        "- ✅ No coding required\n",
        "- ✅ See the full MCP protocol messages\n",
        "- ✅ Debug issues easily\n",
        "- ✅ Share the URL with others for collaborative testing\n",
        "\n",
        "💡 **Learning Point**: MCP Inspector is invaluable for debugging and demonstrating MCP servers. It shows you exactly what messages are being sent and received, helping you understand the protocol better.\n",

        "Building this multi-agent customer service system gave me hands-on experience with coordinating multiple LLM-powered agents using the A2A protocol and connecting them to a real database through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). I learned how an orchestrator (Router Agent) can interpret user intent, decompose tasks, and delegate responsibilities to specialist agents such as the Customer Data Agent for database operations and the Support Agent for service or troubleshooting requests. Implementing the MCP server also deepened my understanding of how LLM agents can interact with structured data safely and reliably, using well-defined tools instead of hallucinating information. Overall, I gained practical experience in designing modular AI systems that behave more like distributed teams than single models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main challenges involved coordinating asynchronous communication across several agents and ensuring that the Router Agent made the correct decisions when handling multi-intent or multi-step workflows. Debugging agent-to-agent interactions, managing rate limits from the underlying LLM models, and maintaining consistent database state across repeated tests required careful engineering. Another challenge was ensuring that each agent produced outputs in the expected format so the Router Agent could merge results cleanly. Despite these difficulties, the project ultimately demonstrated how powerful multi-agent architectures can be when properly orchestrated—enabling more realistic, scalable, and intelligent customer service workflows."
